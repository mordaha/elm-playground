# My Playground with Elm :)

# Install:

```git clone https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter
cd elm-webpack-starter
npm install
```

If you haven't done so yet, install Elm globally:

```npm install -g elm
```

# Install Elm's dependencies:

```elm package install
```

# Serve locally:

```npm start
```
